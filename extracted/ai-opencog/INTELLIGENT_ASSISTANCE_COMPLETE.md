4. **Demo Validation**: Interactive demonstration shows real-world usage scenarios
5. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Validated coordination between all three agent types

## Usage Examples

### Basic Intelligent Assistance
```typescript
const context: AssistanceContext = {
    currentFile: '/src/components/UserForm.tsx',
    selectedText: 'const [user, setUser] = useState(null);',
    userIntent: 'feature-development',
    projectContext: {
        language: 'typescript',
        framework: 'react',
        dependencies: ['react', 'axios']
    }
};

const assistance = await intelligentAssistant.provideIntelligentAssistance(context);
```

### Debugging Support
```typescript
const debuggingHelp = await intelligentAssistant.provideDebuggingAssistance({
    errorMessage: 'TypeError: Cannot read property "name" of undefined',
    codeContext: 'const userName = user.name;',
    expectedBehavior: 'Should display user name',
    actualBehavior: 'Throws TypeError'
});
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration
```typescript
// Combined analysis using all three agents
const analysis = await comprehensiveAnalyzer.performComprehensiveCognitiveAnalysis(fileUri);
const assistance = await intelligentAssistant.provideIntelligentAssistance(context);
const reasoning = await advancedReasoner.solveComplexProblem(problemContext);
```
