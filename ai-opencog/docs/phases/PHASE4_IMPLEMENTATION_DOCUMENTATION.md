## Implementation Details

### Technology Stack
- **UI Framework**: React with Theia's React integration
- **Styling**: CSS with Theia theming variables
- **State Management**: Component-level state with React hooks
- **Dependency Injection**: Theia's Inversify container
- **Event Handling**: Theia's event system

### Integration Points

#### Service Integration
All widgets integrate with existing Phase 3 services:
- `RealTimeCodeAnalyzer` for code intelligence
- `UserBehaviorLearningAgent` for learning progress
- `KnowledgeManagementService` for knowledge exploration
- `IntelligentAssistanceAgent` for assistant functionality
- `OpenCogService` for core cognitive operations

#### Widget System Integration
Follows Theia's standard widget patterns:
- Extends `BaseWidget` with React rendering
- Implements proper lifecycle management
- Uses Theia's command and menu systems
- Supports multiple view areas (main, side, bottom)

### Commands and Menu Integration

The implementation provides comprehensive command integration:

```typescript
// Available commands
SHOW_CODE_INTELLIGENCE      // Show Code Intelligence widget
SHOW_LEARNING_PROGRESS       // Show Learning Progress widget  
SHOW_KNOWLEDGE_EXPLORER      // Show Knowledge Explorer widget
SHOW_COGNITIVE_ASSISTANT     // Show Cognitive Assistant widget
TOGGLE_ALL_COGNITIVE_WIDGETS // Toggle all widgets at once
```

Commands are accessible via:
- View → Cognitive Views submenu
- Command palette
- Programmatic execution

### Styling and Theming

#### CSS Architecture
- Component-specific CSS classes with BEM methodology
- Theia theme variable integration for consistent appearance
- Responsive design with mobile-friendly breakpoints
- Smooth transitions and animations

#### Theme Integration
Uses Theia's CSS custom properties:
- `--theia-editor-background`
- `--theia-foreground`
- `--theia-input-background`
- `--theia-button-background`
- And many more for consistent theming

### Performance Considerations

#### Optimization Features
- Lazy loading of widget content
- Efficient React rendering with proper key management
- Debounced user input handling
- Periodic updates with configurable intervals
- Memory-efficient disposal patterns

#### Resource Management
- Proper cleanup of event listeners
- Interval clearing on widget disposal
- React component unmounting
- Service subscription management

## Usage Examples

### Programmatic Widget Access

```typescript
// Open Code Intelligence widget
commands.executeCommand('cognitive.show-code-intelligence');

// Access widget instance
const widget = await widgetManager.getOrCreateWidget(CodeIntelligenceWidget.ID);
shell.addWidget(widget, { area: 'right' });
```

### Service Integration

```typescript
// Widget automatically connects to services via dependency injection
@inject(RealTimeCodeAnalyzer)
protected readonly realTimeAnalyzer: RealTimeCodeAnalyzer;

// Listens for analysis updates
this.toDispose.push(this.realTimeAnalyzer.onAnalysisCompleted((result) => {
    this.updateData(result);
}));
```

## Real-time Cognitive Feedback

The implementation provides comprehensive real-time feedback mechanisms across all cognitive widgets:

### Code Intelligence Real-time Updates
- **Event-driven**: Listens to `RealTimeCodeAnalyzer.onAnalysisCompleted` events
- **Debounced analysis**: Prevents excessive updates during rapid code changes
- **Instant visualization**: Updates quality metrics, issues, and recommendations in real-time
- **Performance optimization**: Analyzes code patterns continuously with minimal performance impact

### Cognitive Assistant Context Awareness
- **Editor integration**: Automatically tracks active editor changes via `EditorManager.onActiveEditorChanged`
- **Context updates**: Real-time detection of current file, language, and framework
- **Smart framework detection**: Automatic identification of project type (Node.js, Python, Java, C++)
- **Continuous context**: Maintains current development context for intelligent assistance

### Learning Progress Monitoring
- **Periodic updates**: 30-second intervals for learning statistics and progress
- **Adaptive display**: Shows recent learning events and adaptation strategies
- **Behavioral tracking**: Monitors learning effectiveness and confidence levels
- **Non-intrusive**: Updates occur in background without disrupting workflow

### Sensor-Motor Feedback Loop
- **Cognitive-motor cycle**: 30-second intervals for pattern analysis and actuator responses
- **Performance monitoring**: Tracks memory usage, build times, and error patterns
- **Proactive optimization**: Suggests improvements based on detected performance issues
- **Reasoning-driven**: Uses OpenCog reasoning for intelligent feedback generation

### Event Management
All real-time feedback mechanisms include proper lifecycle management:
- Event listeners are properly disposed when widgets are closed
- Memory leaks are prevented through `DisposableCollection` usage
- Performance is optimized through debouncing and interval management

```bash
# Run widget tests
npm test -- --grep "Cognitive Visualization Widgets"
```
