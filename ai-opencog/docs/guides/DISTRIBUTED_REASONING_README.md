# Distributed Reasoning Capabilities - Phase 5 Implementation

## Overview

The distributed reasoning capabilities enable the SKZ framework to distribute complex reasoning tasks across multiple nodes, providing enhanced performance, reliability, and scalability. This implementation builds on the existing reasoning engines (PLN, Pattern Matching, Code Analysis) by adding distributed coordination and result aggregation.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **DistributedReasoningService**: Main service interface for distributed reasoning operations
2. **ReasoningNodeWorker**: Worker implementation that executes reasoning tasks on individual nodes  
3. **NodeRegistry**: Manages registration and tracking of reasoning nodes
4. **TaskQueue**: Handles task distribution and status tracking
5. **ResultAggregator**: Combines results from multiple nodes using various strategies
6. **LoadBalancer**: Optimizes task distribution across available nodes
7. **FaultTolerance**: Handles node failures and ensures system resilience

### Communication Architecture

The distributed reasoning system uses Theia's existing RPC framework for communication:

- **Service Registration**: Nodes register with the central coordinator
- **Heartbeat Monitoring**: Regular health checks ensure node availability
- **Task Distribution**: Tasks are assigned to suitable nodes based on capabilities and load
- **Result Aggregation**: Multiple node results are combined using consensus algorithms

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Node Management

## Usage Examples

### Basic Distributed Reasoning

```typescript
import { DistributedReasoningService } from '@theia/ai-opencog';

// Submit a reasoning task
const query: ReasoningQuery = {
    type: 'deductive',
    atoms: [/* reasoning atoms */],
    context: { domain: 'software-architecture' }
};

const result = await distributedReasoningService.submitTask(query, {
    priority: 'high',
    maxNodes: 3,
    minConfidence: 0.8
});

console.log(`Result confidence: ${result.aggregatedResult.confidence}`);
console.log(`Consensus level: ${result.consensusLevel}`);
console.log(`Nodes used: ${result.nodesUsed}`);
```

### Node Registration

```typescript
// Register a reasoning node
const nodeId = await distributedReasoningService.registerNode({
    endpoint: 'http://reasoning-node-1:8080',
    capabilities: ['deductive', 'pattern-matching', 'code-analysis'],
    metadata: { region: 'us-east', tier: 'premium' }
});

// Send periodic heartbeats
setInterval(async () => {
    await distributedReasoningService.sendHeartbeat({
        nodeId,
        status: 'online',
        workload: 0.3,
        performance: {
            averageResponseTime: 150,
            tasksCompleted: 42,
            tasksErrored: 1,
            uptime: Date.now() - startTime,
            reliability: 0.98
        },
        timestamp: Date.now()
    });
}, 5000);
```

### System Monitoring

```typescript
// Get system statistics
const stats = await distributedReasoningService.getSystemStats();
console.log(`Active nodes: ${stats.activeNodes}/${stats.totalNodes}`);
console.log(`System throughput: ${stats.systemThroughput} tasks/sec`);
console.log(`Average response time: ${stats.averageResponseTime}ms`);
console.log(`System reliability: ${stats.systemReliability}`);

// Check system health
const health = await distributedReasoningService.healthCheck();
if (!health.healthy) {
    console.warn('System health issues:', health.issues);
}
```

## Configuration

The distributed reasoning system supports extensive configuration:

```typescript
const config: DistributedReasoningConfig = {
    maxNodes: 20,                                    // Maximum number of nodes
    defaultTimeout: 60000,                          // Default task timeout (ms)
    heartbeatInterval: 5000,                        // Heartbeat interval (ms)
    nodeTimeoutThreshold: 15000,                    // Node timeout threshold (ms)
    defaultAggregationStrategy: 'confidence-weighted', // Result aggregation
    defaultConsensusAlgorithm: 'weighted-consensus',   // Consensus algorithm
    minConsensusLevel: 0.7,                         // Minimum consensus required
    loadBalancingStrategy: 'least-loaded',          // Load balancing strategy
    faultToleranceLevel: 'high',                    // Fault tolerance level
    enablePerformanceMonitoring: true              // Enable performance tracking
};

await distributedReasoningService.updateConfig(config);
```

## Integration with SKZ Framework

export class DistributedCodeAnalysisAgent {
    
    @inject(DistributedReasoningService)
    protected distributedReasoning: DistributedReasoningService;
    
    async analyzeCodebase(codebase: string[]): Promise<AnalysisResult> {
        // Distribute analysis across multiple nodes
        const query: ReasoningQuery = {
            type: 'code-analysis',
            context: { codebase },
            parameters: { analysisType: 'comprehensive' }
        };
        
        const result = await this.distributedReasoning.submitTask(query, {
            priority: 'high',
            requiredCapabilities: ['code-analysis'],
            maxNodes: 5
        });
        
        return this.processDistributedResult(result);
    }
}
```

### Multi-Modal Processing Integration

Distributed reasoning works with multi-modal data processing:

```typescript
// Distribute multi-modal reasoning tasks
const multiModalQuery: ReasoningQuery = {
    type: 'cross-modal-fusion',
    context: {
        textData: documentText,
        imageData: screenshots,
        audioData: userComments
    },
    parameters: { fusionStrategy: 'attention-based' }
};

const result = await distributedReasoningService.submitTask(multiModalQuery, {
    requiredCapabilities: ['multi-modal', 'tensor-processing'],
    maxNodes: 4
