### Coding Standards

#### TypeScript/JavaScript

```typescript
// Use meaningful names
class CognitiveReasoningAgent implements Agent {
    private readonly knowledgeBase: KnowledgeBase;
    
    constructor(
        @inject(KnowledgeManagementService) 
        private readonly knowledgeService: KnowledgeManagementService
    ) {}
    
    async performReasoning(query: ReasoningQuery): Promise<ReasoningResult> {
        // Implementation with proper error handling
        try {
            const result = await this.processQuery(query);
            return this.formatResult(result);
        } catch (error) {
            this.logger.error('Reasoning failed', { query, error });
            throw new ReasoningError('Failed to process reasoning query', error);
        }
    }
}
```

#### File Organization

```
src/
├── common/           # Shared interfaces and services
├── browser/          # Frontend implementation
├── node/            # Backend implementation
└── test/            # Test files
```

#### Testing

```typescript
// Example test
describe('CognitiveReasoningAgent', () => {
    let agent: CognitiveReasoningAgent;
    let mockKnowledgeService: sinon.SinonStubbedInstance<KnowledgeManagementService>;
    
    beforeEach(() => {
        mockKnowledgeService = sinon.createStubInstance(KnowledgeManagementService);
        agent = new CognitiveReasoningAgent(mockKnowledgeService);
    });
    
    it('should perform basic reasoning', async () => {
        // Arrange
        const query = createTestQuery();
        mockKnowledgeService.query.resolves(createTestResult());
        
        // Act
        const result = await agent.performReasoning(query);
        
        // Assert
        expect(result).to.be.defined;
        expect(result.success).to.be.true;
    });
});
```

### Cognitive Agent Development

#### Creating New Agents

```typescript
import { Agent, AgentResult } from '../common/agent-types';
import { injectable, inject } from '@theia/core/shared/inversify';

@injectable()
export class CustomCognitiveAgent implements Agent {
    
    async execute(parameters: any): Promise<AgentResult> {
        // Agent implementation
        return {
            success: true,
            message: 'Agent executed successfully',
            data: parameters.processedData
        };
    }
    
    async learn(feedback: any): Promise<void> {
        // Learning implementation
    }
}
```

#### Agent Registration

```typescript
// In frontend module
bind(Symbol.for('Agent')).to(CustomCognitiveAgent).inSingletonScope();
```

## Documentation Contributions

### Documentation Standards

#### API Documentation

Use JSDoc for TypeScript code:

```typescript
/**
 * Performs cognitive reasoning on the given query.
 * 
 * @param query - The reasoning query to process
 * @param options - Optional reasoning parameters
 * @returns Promise resolving to reasoning result
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const result = await agent.performReasoning({
 *     type: 'deductive',
 *     premises: ['All humans are mortal', 'Socrates is human'],
 *     goal: 'Socrates is mortal'
 * });
 * ```
 */
async performReasoning(
    query: ReasoningQuery, 
    options?: ReasoningOptions
): Promise<ReasoningResult> {
    // Implementation
}
```

#### User Documentation

Use clear, step-by-step instructions:

```markdown
## Using the Cognitive Assistant

1. **Open the Assistant**: 
   - Go to View → Tools → Cognitive Assistant
   - Or use keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl+Shift+C`

2. **Ask a Question**:
   ```
   How can I optimize this function for better performance?
   ```

3. **Review Suggestions**:
   The assistant will analyze your code and provide specific recommendations.
```
